  Configuration sources in ASP.NET Core
    - Files (appsettings.json, appsettings.{Environment}.json)
        - Eg. appsettings.development.json or appsettings.production.json
        - The settings in the above file will OVERWRITE appsettings.json
    - User Secrets
    - Environment Variables
        - Can be stored in the launchsettings.json (look in launchsettings.json)
    - Command-line arguments

  To access configuration information
    - IConfiguration Service (Look at Startup file, it uses dependency injection)

  Hierarchy: Command-line arguments > Environment Variables > User Secrets > Files
